Abstract
We used the Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) to identify and quantify the duration of > 1 MeV electron microbursts. We investigated trends
in the microburst duration as a function of geomagnetic activity, L-shell, and magnetic
local time (MLT)—with the clearest trend in MLT. The median microburst duration doubles from 80 milliseconds at midnight to 160 milliseconds noon MLT. The increasing microburst duration as a function of MLT is similar to the whistler mode chorus rising tone
element duration, but theory does not conclusively predict what chorus wave properties
control microburst duration.

Plain Language Summary
Does this summary read well now?
Energetic electron microbursts are an intense form of naturally occurring particle precipitation from the outer Van Allen Radiation Belt into Earth’s atmosphere. Microbursts
are observed in, or just above, Earth’s atmosphere, and are characterized by their short
duration in time series data, often assumed to be less than a second. The impact of microburst precipitation on Earth’s atmosphere is uncertain, but has been predicted to substantially degrade Mesospheric Ozone through the production of Odd Nitrogen and Odd
Hydrogen molecules. Besides their environmental impact, we don’t comprehensively understand how plasma waves, such as whistler mode chorus waves, scatter microbursts
into our atmosphere. Therefore, in this study we quantified the duration of microbursts
and used it as a proxy to study how microbursts are scattered by these waves. We found
that microbursts and chorus waves share at least one strong statistical trend (correlation?): their duration roughly doubles between the anti-sunward and sunward regions
of the outer radiation belt.

1 Introduction
Earth’s outer Van Allen radiation belt electron population is in constant flux, governed by many processes that affect charged particles via, for example: radial transport,
injections from the magnetotail, magnetopause shadowing, and local heating and loss
into Earth’s atmosphere due to wave-particle interactions (e.g. Ripoll et al., 2020, and
references within). Whistler mode chorus (WMC) is just one type of plasma wave characterized by short (≈ 100 ms) rising tone elements, and perform a dual role in electron
dynamics: accelerating electrons from 10s of keV to MeV energies, as well as pitch angle scattering electrons into the atmosphere (e.g. Li, Thorne, Angelopoulos, Bonnell, et
al., 2009; Thorne, 2010; Horne & Thorne, 2003; Summers, 2005). One form of electron
precipitation are microbursts: a transient and intense increase of electrons, with a subsecond duration. Microbursts were first observed by balloons in Earth’s upper atmosphere,
and later by satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), and recently at high altitude near the
magnetic equator (e.g. Anderson & Milton, 1964; Blake et al., 1996; Lorentzen et al., 2001;
O’Brien et al., 2003; Douma et al., 2017; Kurita et al., 2016; Shumko et al., 2018).
Microburst electron energies span multiple orders of magnitude from tens of keV
observed by, for example, Datta et al. (1997); to > 1 MeV observed by the Solar Anomalous Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) by Blum et al. (2015). Microbursts
are predominately observed outside the plasmapause on the radiation belt footprints, L ≈
4 − 8, and in the midnight to morning Magnetic Local Times (MLT) (≈ 0 − 12 hours
MLT) (Lorentzen et al., 2001; Blum et al., 2015; O’Brien et al., 2003; Douma et al., 2017).
While microbursts are observed under all geomagnetic conditions, Douma et al. (2017)
showed that microburst frequency dramatically increases with the Auroral Electrojet (AE)
index, and O’Brien et al. (2003) showed a similar trend with the microburst frequency
with the Disturbance storm time index.

The relative impact of energetic electron precipitation on the ionization of Earth’s
atmosphere and the depletion of radiation belt electrons is uncertain, but is estimated
to be substantial. Duderstadt et al. (2021) showed observations that suggest that electron precipitation can significantly impact atmospheric composition. The authors estimated a 20-30% increase in atmospheric Odd Nitrogen (NOX ), leading to a 1% decrease
in Ozone (O3 )—substantial enough to affect the radiative balance in the upper atmosphere. Specifically, the impact of microbursts alone is estimated to be substantial. Microbursts can deplete the outer radiation belt electrons in as little as a few hours, and
models predict depletions of up to 20% of upper mesospheric O3 (O’Brien et al., 2004;
Thorne et al., 2005; Douma et al., 2019; Breneman et al., 2017; Seppälä et al., 2018).
Electron microbursts are widely believed to be scattered by chorus waves. They
were associated early on, due to the similar duration of microbursts and chorus rising
tone elements, and a similar occurrence distributions in MLT (e.g. Lorentzen et al., 2001).
Breneman et al. (2017) directly linked a chorus rising tone element to a microburst observed by the Focused Investigation of Relativistic Electron Bursts: Intensity, Range, and
Dynamics CubeSats (FIREBIRD-II; Crew et al. (2016); Johnson et al. (2020)) during
a close magnetic conjunction.
A natural follow-on question is how are microbursts scattered. For example, it is
still unclear if relativistic (> 1 MeV) microbursts are scattered via cyclotron resonance
at high magnetic latitudes, or a higher resonance harmonic near the magnetic equator
(Lorentzen et al., 2001). One way to address this question is by studying for how long
microburst electrons are in resonance with a chorus wave. The resulting microburst duration, i.e. the microburst width in the time series data, is a probe into the conditions
necessary to scatter microburst electrons. Therefore, we used microbursts observed by
the SAMPEX satellite to quantify the distribution of relativistic microburst duration.
In this letter, we quantify the duration distribution of microbursts as a function of Lshell, MLT, and the Auroral Electrojet. We then compare these results to prior chorus
rising tone element studies, and a chorus-electron scattering model.

2 Instrumentation
In this study we used the > 1 MeV electron count data, taken by the Heavy Ion
Large Telescope (HILT) instrument (Klecker et al., 1993), onboard the SAMPEX satellite (Baker et al., 1993).
SAMPEX was launched in July 1992 and reentered Earth’s atmosphere in November 2012. It was in a 520x670 km, 82◦ inclination low Earth orbit. In general, SAMPEX
had two pointing modes: spin and orbit rate rotation (zenith pointing) modes. To avoid
the compounding effects due to the variable pitch angles sampled in the spin mode, we
only used the zenith pointing mode data. The International Geomagnetic Reference Field
(Thébault et al., 2015, IGRF) magnetic field model was used to derive the meomagnetic
coordinates.
We used the HILT electron data, sampled at a 20 ms cadence (state4 in the data
archive), taken between 1997 and 2012. The HILT instrument consisted of a large rectangular chamber with the aperture on one end, and 16 solid state detectors on the other.
The electron counts accumulated over 20 ms were summed from all of the solid state detectors and used in this study.

3 Methodology
We first identified microbursts. Then we fit every microburst’s time series to a model,
consisting of a Gaussian superposed with a straight line, to quantify the duration for each
microburst.

Examples of relativistic microbursts are shown by the black lines, and the fits are

shown by the dashed red lines. The fit’s full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the R̄2 goodness of fit metric is annotated in each panel. Microbursts with R̄2 > 0.9 were used for this study.
The major time ticks are at every second, while the minor ticks are at every 100 milliseconds.

3.1 Microburst Identification
We identified microbursts using the burst parameter defined by O’Brien et al. (2003)
and used in numerous other microburst studies with SAMPEX (e.g. Douma et al., 2017).
Assuming Poisson probability for the observed electron counts, the burst parameter is
the number of standard deviations of a foreground signal above the background, expressed
as
N −A
nσ = √
(1)
A+1
where N is the number of foreground electron counts (microburst or otherwise), and A
is the centered running average background counts. The 1 in the denominator prevents
a division by 0 error. In O’Brien et al. (2003), and in the results in this study, N was
summed over 100 ms and is called N100 , while A was summed over 500 ms and is similarly called A500 . Henceforth, we specify the time windows with subscripts for N and
A. Times when nσ > 10 are classified as burst times, and the time at the peak count
rate in each continuos burst time interval is added to the microburst data set. With A500
and N100 , we detected a total of 256,764 microbursts over the 15 year period from 1997
to 2012. Four examples of microbursts are shown in Fig. 1 by the solid black curves.
3.2 Fitting to Quantify Microburst Duration
We estimated the microburst duration using two methods that yielded similar results: the duration at half of the microburst’s topographic prominence and the full width
at half maximum (FWHM) from a Gaussian fit.
The topographic prominence is a simple and robust method to estimate the microburst duration used to identify curtains, a similar-looking type of precipitation (Shumko
et al., 2020). It is defined as the duration at half of the microburst’s topographic prominence: the height of the microburst relative to the maximum of the two minima on either side of the microburst peak. On each side of the microburst peak, the minima are
searched for between the microburst and a higher peak on that side. While the topographic
prominence method of estimating microburst durations is simple and robust, one of its
downsides is its inability to automatically verify that the duration is representative of
a single microburst. Therefore, we also fit microbursts with a Gaussian, and used the
R2 goodness of fit metric to filter out bad duration estimates. By screening out bad fits,
we exclude superposition of multiple microbursts that will bias our microburst duration
estimates.

We assumed a Gaussian superposed with a straight line fit model. The Gaussian
models the shape of the microburst; while the linear trend accounts for the background
electrons that are either trapped or quasi-trapped in the drift loss cone. The fit model
is defined as:
c(t|A, t0 , σ, c0 , c1 ) = Ae−

(t−t0 )2
2σ 2

+ c0 + c1 t

(2)

where A, t0 , and σ are the Gaussian amplitude, center time, and standard deviation; while
the c0 and c1 are the background count intercept and slope. The fit was applied over a
number of data points determined by the maximum of either: 4x topographic prominence
width or 500 ms. A challenge to any robust and automated nonlinear regression algorithm is guessing the initial parameters. The initial parameter guesses for the Gaussian
are provided by the topographic prominence and topographic duration estimates. The
two linear trend initial parameters were: c0 = median(counts) and c1 = 0. The optimal fit parameters were found using scipy’s curve fit() function in Python. We defined
the microburst duration as the FWHM of the microburst peak, defined by
√
FWHM = 2 2 ln 2σ.

(3)

To evaluate the fit, we used the R2 goodness of fit metric. R2 is defined as
R2 = 1 −

P
SSres
(ci − fi )2
=1− P
(ci − c̄)2
SSmean

(4)

where SSres is the sum of the squared residuals between the observed counts ci and the
fit counts fi for each time step, and likewise SSmean is the sum of the squared residuals between ci and the mean of the counts, c̄.
One interpretation of R2 is: fractionally how much better is the variance in the data
explained by the model fit, compared to the null hypothesis horizontal line at c̄. R2 values vary from 1 when the fit perfectly describes the variance in the data, to −∞ for poor
fits (a fit can be much worse than the mean null hypothesis).
To account for overfitting that results from the variable number of data points used
for each fit, the adjusted R2 , R̄2 , was used. It is defined as

R̄2 = 1 − (1 − R2 )

n−1
n−p−1

(5)

where n is the number of data points fit, and p is the number of parameters. Intuitively,
n − 1 is the number of degrees of freedom for the null hypothesis, and n − p − 1 is the
degrees of freedom for the fit model. Fits with R̄2 > 0.9 are considered good fits and
are used for the rest of this analysis. As a check, we compared the microburst duration
estimated with the prominence and fit methods. Does the following sentence make more
sense now? We chose an agreement criterion between the two methods as durations within
25%; together with the R̄2 > 0.9 constraint, 85% of microbursts satisfied this agreement criterion.
Figure 1a shows an example of two superposed microbursts that had a fit R̄2 =
0.83 that were excluded from this study. On other hand, Fig. 1b-d show microbursts that
were included in this study because the fit R̄2 > 0.9.
Lastly, Fig. 1c,d demonstrate the necessity of the linear fit to account for the changing background. The linear fit accounts for the non-zero mean background counts and
the different amplitudes of the edges of the Gaussian. Of the 256,764 detected microbursts,
109,231 had R̄2 > 0.9 and are used for the remainder of this study.

Panel a shows the distribution of all microburst full width at full maximum

(FWHM). Panel b shows the distribution of all microbursts, categorized by the Auroral Electroject (AE) index into three bins: AE < 100, 100 < AE < 300, and AE > 300, in units of
nanotesla. The median microburst duration is 130 ms for the AE < 100 (2.4 × 103 microbursts),
111 ms for the 100 < AE < 300 (1.8 × 104 microbursts), and 95 ms for the AE > 300 (9.3 × 104
microbursts) bins.

4 Results
We used the well-fit microbursts to quantify the distribution of microburst duration (FWHM) as a function of the Auroral Electrojet index, L-shell and MLT. We begin with the overall microburst distribution.
Figure 2a shows the distribution of all well-fit microbursts. This distribution is peaked
with the median at 96 ms and quickly drops off. The interquartile range spans about a
factor of two in microburst duration, from 65 to 139 ms. A new sanity check! As a check,
we quantified the variation in the percentiles, annotated in Fig. 2a, under varying R̄2
criteria. We found that the percentile variation is minor—the median discrepancy between R̄2 > 0.5 and R̄2 > 0.9 thresholds is 4 ms.
We then investigated the dependence of microburst duration as a function of geomagnetic activity. To be consistent with the prior wave and microburst studies, we use
the AE index to quantify the level of geomagnetic disturbance. We adopt the same three
AE intensity levels used in prior studies, such as Li, Thorne, Angelopoulos, Bortnik, et
al. (2009), Douma et al. (2017), and Meredith et al. (2020): AE < 100, 100 < AE <
300, and AE > 300, in units of nanotesla. Figure 2b shows the distribution of microburst
duration for the three AE categories. The distributions are qualitatively similar, gradually narrowing and shifting to shorter durations with increasing AE. The median microburst duration decreases from 130 ms for AE < 100 to 95 ms for AE > 300.
Lastly, Figs. 3 and 4 show the microburst duration as a function of L and MLT.
Figure 3a-c shows the joint distributions, split up into the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles;
Figure 4 shows the marginalized distributions as a function of L or MLT.
Figure 3 shows that the microburst duration trend is nearly identical for the different percentiles, and thus for simplicity we focus on the median distribution in Fig. 3b.

The joint distributions of microburst duration (FWHM) as a function of L-Shell

and MLT. Panels a-c show the 25th, 50th, and 75th duration percentiles in each L-MLT bin.
The white bins in panels a-c have a statistically insufficient number of microbursts (less than
100). Lastly, panel d shows the distribution of the number of microbursts, with the white bins
containing 0 microbursts.

In MLT, the median microburst duration increases by roughly a factor of two: from 80
ms at midnight to 160 ms at noon. In L-shell, the median microburst duration faintly
increases with L-shell, and is most apparent near midnight MLT.
To disentangle the L and MLT distributions, Fig. 4 shows the marginalized distributions; MLT was marginalized out in Fig. 4a and L-shell was marginalized out in Fig.
4b. Figure 4a shows a slight broadening of the microburst duration at higher L-shells—
in contrast to Fig. 4b that clearly shows that the microburst duration increases from midnight to noon MLT.

5 Discussion and Conclusions
We first discuss a possibility that the burst parameter is less sensitive to microbursts
with longer durations and is therefore not detecting them. Recall from Section 3.1 that
A is the running average counts, centered on the foreground counts N , and the burst parameter, nσ ∼ N − A. Now consider the following hypothesized scenario. Given a microburst with a 500 ms duration and the burst parameter centered on the peak, A500 completely overlaps with the microburst and is therefore the mean microburst counts. Then,
nσ is proportional to the difference between the mean and the maximum microburst am-

plitude. However, if we use A1000 , the mean background counts no longer overlap with
just the microburst, but rather the microburst and the lower surrounding background.
The resulting A1000 is lower than A500 and thus the A1000 burst parameter is more sensitive to the microburst.
To test this possible bias, we ran the detection algorithm with three background
values: A500 , A1000 , and A2000 and compared the resulting median distributions. The
maximum discrepancy in the median microburst duration using the three resulting data
sets was 20 ms (one data point); the longer median duration from a longer A. This is
a 20% relative discrepancy. Consequently, considering this bias and the distribution in
Fig. 2a, the evidence supports that the majority of > 1 MeV microbursts have a true
duration around 100 ms and the A500 is adequate to identify them. With more confidence in the detection algorithm, we now shift to the global distribution of microburst
durations.
The microburst duration trend in L-shell is subtle; Fig. 3c, and Fig. 4a most clearly
show longer durations at higher L-shells near midnight MLT. In contrast, the duration
trend in MLT is significant. The median microburst duration doubles from 80 to 160 ms
between midnight and noon MLT. Now we will focus on the MLT trend and look for a
possible explanation.
As mention in the introduction, chorus rising tone elements are widely believed to
scatter microburst electrons (e.g. Breneman et al., 2017; Saito et al., 2012; Miyoshi et
al., 2020). Thus, we will compare the microburst duration and chorus trends in local time.
Recent studies by Teng et al. (2017) and Shue et al. (2019) quantified the properties of
equatorial lower band (0.1-0.5 x electron gyrofrequency) chorus rising tone elements. Both
studies found that the rising tone element duration distribution peaks at ≈ 250 ms around
midnight, and this peak broadens and shifts to ≈ 500 ms at noon MLT. The microburst
duration and chorus rising tone element trends in MLT scale by roughly the same factor of 2, but in general the chorus rising tone element duration is roughly 3 times longer
than > 1 MeV microbursts. However, theory points to a different chorus property controlling the microburst duration.

Figure 4 in Chen et al. (2020) shows the result of a microburst test particle simulation. The authors described what wave properties bound the microburst duration in
time-energy space. Medium energy (≈ 50−300 keV) microburst duration is controlled
by the rising tone element bandwidth. Moreover, higher energy microburst duration is
controlled by the wave’s lower frequency and the upper magnetic latitude propagation.
This is in qualitative agreement with the cyclotron resonance condition described in Lorentzen
et al. (2001), and the electron time of flight described by Saito et al. (2012).
While different model configurations may change what wave properties are theoretically responsible for scattering > 1 MeV microburst electrons, it is worth noting that
Figs. 4 and 5 in Shue et al. (2019) do not show a clear shift in chorus bandwidth between
midnight and noon MLT. Presently, the theory does not conclusively predict what chorus wave properties control the > 1 MeV microburst duration, but the chorus rising tone
duration trend in MLT is worth further consideration.
As for the AE trend, the median microburst duration decreases from 130 ms, for
AE < 100 nT, to 95 ms for AE > 300 nT. The chorus rising tone duration trend, quantified by Teng et al. (2017), is similar: it is broad and peaks at ≈ 500 ms when AE <
100 nT, then narrows and shifts to ≈ 250 ms when AE > 300 nT. While both tend
to become shorter with increased AE, the scaling factors are different.
Lastly, high latitude chorus waves, found at ≈ 10−25 degrees magnetic latitude
off of the equator, can also play at important role at scattering microburst electrons (Lorentzen
et al., 2001). Li, Thorne, Angelopoulos, Bortnik, et al. (2009) found that the majority
of high latitude chorus waves are constrained to 6-12 MLT. Thus, it is tempting to conclude that the microburst duration trend in MLT can be attributed to the low and high
latitude chorus waves. However, because low latitude chorus waves are also observed at
0-12 MLT (Li, Thorne, Angelopoulos, Bortnik, et al., 2009), the resulting microburst duration distribution would reflect the chorus wave superposition in the 6-12 MLT region.
If low and high latitude chorus waves scattered microbursts with different durations, Fig.
4b would show the durations broaden or bifurcate from midnight to noon MLT. Because
Fig. 4b shows the microburst duration only shift to longer durations, high vs low latitude chorus waves are an unlikely explanation for the microburst duration trend in MLT.
In summary, we found that the relativistic microburst duration distribution is peaked
at 100 ms, with 75% of microbursts narrower than 140 ms. We found no significant trend
in the microburst duration as a function of L-shell, but we did find a strong trend as a
function of MLT—the median microburst duration roughly doubles from 80 ms at midnight, to 160 ms at noon MLT. We found that the microburst duration trend in MLT
scales similarly to the rising tone element duration, but the rising tone element duration
is longer. Nonetheless, at this time theory is inconclusive: it does not predict that the
relativistic microburst duration is controlled by the rising tone element duration, but rather
by the chorus bandwidth and/or the upper latitude of propagation.
