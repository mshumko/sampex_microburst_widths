\begin{abstract}
In this study we used the Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer to identify relativistic, $>1$ MeV, electron microbursts and we quantified their duration. We found the shortest microbursts, with a median duration around 80 milliseconds, near midnight magnetic local time. Microburst duration increases through dawn and to noon magnetic local time, where the median microburst duration roughly doubles to 160 milliseconds. The increasing microburst duration trend in magnetic local time is similar to the whistler mode chorus rising tone element duration, shedding light into the microburst scattering mechanism.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Plain Language Summary}
\noindent Microbursts are a naturally occurring form of electron precipitation from the near-Earth space into the atmosphere. They are characterized by their short duration, typically defined to be less than a second, or sometimes as 100 milliseconds... Microburst impact on the atmosphere includes the degradation of Mesospheric Ozone through the production of Odd Nitrogen and Odd Hydrogen molecules... We don't know the details on how microburst electrons are scattered, but there is evidence that they are scattered by whistler-mode chorus rising tone elements... Talk about duration and how it is a probe into the scattering physics.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}
\textcolor{blue}{
\textbf{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The methodology consists of two main steps: identify microbursts and estimate their duration.
    \item We identified microbursts using the Burst parameter. Mention the bias and how we addressed it.
    \item Discuss biases to short width, low counts. Douma 2019 showed that the microburst fluxes are roughly uniform in MLT (could this comparison be invalid since Douma also used the burst parameter?)
    \item Ref Fig 1 microbursts.
    \item Estimate microburst width using two methods:
    \item The prominence width method (cite my other paper).
    \item Gaussian + trend fit. Trend is important to approximate the drifting electrons in the DLC. automating fits is difficult so we helped out: the initial parameter guesses were provided from the prominence method, and the quality of fit checked with the $r^2$ and adj $r^2$. Provide the definition of $r^2$ used here and state the goodness of fit threshold we used.  
    \item Ref Fig 1 microbursts + fits. Mention the benefit of the linear trend, and screening out of multiple, superposed microbursts, by r2.
\end{enumerate}
}

To estimate the microburst duration we first identified microbursts and then we fit them with a Gaussian function.

\subsection{Microburst Identification}\label{microburst_id}
We identified microbursts using the burst parameter defined by \citeA{O'Brien2003} and used in numerous other microburst studies with SAMPEX \cite<e.g.>{Douma2017}. Assuming Poisson probability for the observed electron counts, the burst parameter is the number of standard deviations of a foreground signal above the background. It is generally defined as
\begin{equation}
bp = \frac{N-A}{\sqrt{A+1}}
\end{equation} \textcolor{red}{Find a better variable than bp. This is not British Petroleum} where $N$ is the number of foreground electron counts (microburst or otherwise), and $A$ is the centered running average counts representing the background. The $1$ in the denominator prevents a division by 0 error. In \citeA{O'Brien2003}, and in the results in this study, $N$ was summed over 0.1 seconds and is called $N_{100}$, while $A$ parameter was summed over 0.5 seconds and is called $A_{500}$. Henceforth we will specify the time window with the subscript for $N$ and $A$. With $A_{500}$ and $N_{100}$, we detected a total of 256,764 microbursts over the 13 year period from 1997 to 2012. Four examples of microbursts are shown in Fig. \ref{fig1} by the solid black curves.

The choice of $A$ determines the sensitivity of the burst parameter to microbursts of various durations (widths). This sensitivity is best illustrated with an example. Given a 1-second wide microburst, if we use $A_{500}$, the centered average background at the microburst time is scewed higher towards the microburst peak. The average is dominated heavily by the microburst counts. On the other hand, if we use $A_{1000}$, the background will not be elevated as much because more true background counts will be included in the average. Therefore, $bp$ will be relatively larger for $A_{1000}$ than $A_{500}$. This sensitivity manifests itself as a bias towards narrower microbursts that we will address later in this study.

\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Microburst Duration}
We estimated the microburst duration using two methods: the duration at half of the microburst's topographic prominence and Guassian fits.

\textcolor{red}{talk about the prominence method}

An alternative method that can be automatically checked is non-linear regression. For a fit model we assumed a Gaussian superposed with a linear trend. The Gaussian models the shape of the microburst; while the linear trend accounts for the electrons that are either trapped or quasi-trapped in the drift loss cone. The fit model is defined as:
\begin{equation}
c(t | A, t_0, \sigma, c_0, c_1) = A e^{-\frac{(t-t_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}} + c_0 + c_1 t
\end{equation} where $A$, $t_0$, and $\sigma$ are the Gaussian amplitude, center time, and standard deviation; while the $c_0$ and $c_1$ are the background count intercept and slope. The fit was applied over the \textcolor{red}{the following duration, and the initial parameter guess was provided by X}. The optimal fit parameters were found using Python's \url{scipy.curve_fit()} function. We defined the microburst duration as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the microburst peak, defined as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{FWHM} = 2\sqrt{2 \ln{2}} \sigma.
\end{equation}

To evaluate the fit, we used the $R^2$ goodness of fit metric. $R^2$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{total}} = 1 - \frac{\sum{(c_i-f_i)^2}}{\sum{(c_i-\bar{c})^2}}
\end{equation} where $SS_{res}$ is the sum of squares of the residuals between the observed counts $c_i$ and the fit counts $f_i$ for each time stamp, and $SS_{total}$ is the sum of squares between $c_i$ and the mean counts $\bar{c}$.

One interpretation of $R^2$ is: fractionally how much better the model fit explains the variance in the data, compared to a null hypothesis horizontal line fit at $\bar{c}$. When $R^2=1$, the modeled fit perfectly describes the variance in the data, and $R^2$ can be arbitrarily negative for poor fits (a fit can be much worse than the mean).

To account for overfitting that results from the variable number of data points used for each fit, the adjusted $R^2$, $\bar{R}^2$ was used. It is defined as

\begin{equation}
\bar{R}^2 = 1 - (1-R^2) \frac{n-1}{n-p-1}
\end{equation} where $n$ is the number of data points fit, and $p$ is the number of parameters. Intuitively, $n-1$ is the number of degrees of freedom for the null hypothesis, and $n-p-1$ is the degrees of freedom for the fit model. Fits with $\bar{R}^2 > 0.9$ are considered good fits and are used for the rest of this analysis. \textcolor{red}{We compared the microburst durations estimated with the prominence and fit methods. We found that with the $\bar{R}^2 > 0.9$ constraint, both methods yielded $85\%$ of microburst widths to within $25\%$.}

Figure \ref{fig1}a shows an example of two superposed microbursts that had a fit $\bar{R}^2 = 0.83$ that were excluded from this study. On other hand, Fig. \ref{fig1}b-d show microbursts that were included in this study because the fit $\bar{R}^2 > 0.9$.

Lastly, Fig. \ref{fig1}c,d demonstrate the necessity of the linear fit to account for the changing background. The linear fit accounts for the non-zero mean background counts and the different amplitudes of the edges of the Gaussian. Of the 256,764 detected microbursts, 110,135 had $R^2 > 0.9$ and are used for the remainder of this study.

\section{Results}\label{results}
The microbursts that had a good fit are used to quantify the distribution of microburst duration (FWHM) for all microbursts, as a function of L and MLT, and as a function of the Auroral Electroject (AE).

Figure \ref{figX} shows the distribution of all microbursts that had a goodness of fit $\bar{R}^2 > 0.9$. This distribution is peaked at 0.1 seconds and rapidly drops off.

The white bins in panels a-c have less than 100 good microburst fits. Panel d shows the distribution of the number of microbursts with 0 microbursts shown with the white bins.}

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\label{discussion}
\textcolor{blue}{
\textbf{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare to prior microburst width estimates.
    \item Comment that microbursts at lower energy are wider (data + model). The cited microburst widths are dependent by the energy channel of the instrument. 
    \item Compare to chorus rising tone element duration trends.
    \item A few concluding remarks.
\end{enumerate}
}

To address the burst parameter preferential bias to narrower microbursts, as introduced in section \ref{microburst_id}, we ran the microburst identification algorithm on the data using three background values: $A_{500}$, $A_{1000}$, and $A_{1000}$. As described in section \ref{microburst_id}, an detection algorithm who's centered running average is over wider time periods will be more sensitive to wider and less prominent microbursts. Therefore we can identify the bias if there is a relative excess of longer duration microbursts when the average time was increased. We found no such excess for microburst data sets that were made using $A_{1000}$, and $A_{1000}$. Therefore, we believe that $>1$ MeV microbursts are truly narrower than 250 ms and the $A_{500}$ is adequate to identify $>1$ MeV microbursts.
