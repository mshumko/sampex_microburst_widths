# sampex_microbursts
Identify and estimate widths of microbursts in the SAMPEX/HILT 20 ms data.

## Dependencies
Besides the dependencies listed in the ```requirements.txt``, you'll need my ```mission_tools``` and ```microburst_detection``` repos to be cloned on your machine and the path to them resolved.

## Tasks
- [ ] Validate the catalog against Lauren's data
- [ ] Move my dependencies into this repo and make a requirements.txt file.
- [ ] Add microburts browswer
- [] Add prominence-based peak width estimator
- [] Add fit-based peak width estimator
- [] Insorporate a goodness of fit statistic to fits
- [] Look at the distribution of peak widths. 
- [] Check by eye a subset of the dataset. One idea is to pick N examples from each peak width bin and find the error?
